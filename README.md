# Hash Auth
### Overview
This git repo contains a demo of the hash/token verification system that was intended to be implemented for the 3rd round of battle bots. The token generator generates a hash from a string that contains the following ```Process id Seed, CPU Time```. This not only allows for the tokens to be validated by having a list of pre-determined seeds, but the inclusion of CPU time ensures that only tokens that were generated recently are valid. 

### Demo
The demo shows how the token generator can be applied and how key validation would be implemented. The demo will return a true/false terminal print depending on whether the test token (generated by a test seed) matches any seeds that are included in an array of pre-determined valid seeds.
